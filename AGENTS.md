# Production Directives

## 1. Agentic Threat Modeling
* **Objective**: Force the model to perform a structured, scenario-driven threat analysis prior to outputting code or system architecture.
* **Scope Lens (The 5 Threat Zones)**:
  * **Input Surfaces**: Prompts, untrusted user uploads, external API payloads.
  * **Planning & Reasoning**: Prompt injection, system instruction bypass, tool routing hijacking.
  * **Tool Execution**: Privilege escalation via API functions, SSRF, dynamic code execution risks.
  * **Memory & State**: Firestore state persistence, session hijacking, cross-user data leaks.
  * **Inter-System Communication**: External API calls (e.g., Google Maps, Google Sheets), token leakage.
* **Mandatory Execution Criteria**: Whenever the user asks to design or implement a feature, the model must first generate a Threat Summary Table mapping risks to countermeasures.

## 2. Secure Coding Standard
* **Objective**: Support mitigations corresponding with the OWASP Top 10 (Web) and OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications.
* **Core Principles Implemented**:
  * **Input Validation & Sanitization (OWASP A03 / LLM02)**: Strict schema validation for all incoming inputs; explicit parameterization to prevent SQLi, NoSQLi, and Command Injection.
  * **Indirect Prompt Injection Defense (OWASP LLM01)**: Treat data retrieved from untrusted sources (e.g., external APIs, web pages, user files) as plain data, never as executable instructions.
  * **Broken Access Control Mitigation (OWASP A01)**: Validate authorization headers and context-bound permissions at every API boundary.
  * **Output Handling (OWASP A03 / LLM05)**: Encode all dynamic LLM outputs prior to rendering in HTML/JS interfaces or executing downstream system commands.

## 3. Secure Firestore & Firebase Auth Configuration
* **Objective**: Limit data exposure and unauthorized database reads/writes in Firebase/Firestore architectures.
* **Core Security Rules**:
  * **Zero Insecure Defaults**: Never output `allow read, write: if true;`.
  * **User Data Isolation**: Support owner-bound path checking (`request.auth.uid == userId`) for personal documents.
  * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Use custom claims or dynamic document lookups (`get(/databases/$(database)/documents/users/$(request.auth.uid)).data.role`) for elevated administrative operations.
  * **Auth State Integrity**: Verify JWT tokens on backend server environments (e.g., Cloud Functions or Cloud Run) using the Firebase Admin SDK.
  * **Passwordless/Federated Auth**: Do not implement email/password login forms that require handling or storing passwords in the application custom code. Prefer Federated Identity (e.g., Google Sign-In via Firebase Auth) to outsource credential management securely.

## 4. Secret Management & Zero-Hardcoding Hygiene
* **Objective**: Eliminate hardcoded credentials, API keys, service account JSON files, and tokens.
* **Mandatory Code Patterns**:
  * **Prohibit Hardcoded Strings**: Flag any pattern resembling `const API_KEY = "AIzaSy..."` as a critical flaw.
  * **Google Cloud Secret Manager Integration**: Force code to retrieve operational credentials dynamically using Secret Manager or environment variable injection:
  ```python
  from google.cloud import secretmanager

  def access_secret(secret_id: str, version_id: str = "latest") -> str:
      client = secretmanager.SecretManagerServiceClient()
      name = f"projects/your-project-id/secrets/{secret_id}/versions/{version_id}"
      response = client.access_secret_version(request={"name": name})
      return response.payload.data.decode("UTF-8")
  ```

## 5. Security Reviewer Persona
* **Objective**: Review any code for common security issues, based on the threat model and best practices.
* **Review Methodology**:
  * Inspect for hardcoded credentials and unsafe default settings.
  * Map data flow from untrusted entry point to storage/execution sink.
  * Validate access control checks at every function boundary.
  * Provide a severity-ranked vulnerability list with concrete code diffs for remediation.

## 6. Functional Stability & Walkthroughs
* **Objective**: In the absence of writing tests, produce steps to test that a user can walk through, broken down into specific pieces of functionality that another coding tool can turn into actual test scripts. **Every type of process and user interaction that a user can see or trigger must have a corresponding test case written out.**
* **Interactive Functionality**: Any buttons that submit an input, either to Gemini API, Firestore, or any added functionality, must actually work.
* **Gemini Model Resilience & Fallback Protocol**: Whenever implementing server-side or client-side Gemini AI features with `@google/genai`:
  1. **Resilient Model Fallback Ladder**: Never hardcode a single model string to execute content generation in a single try. Always wrap `generateContent` or `generateContentStream` calls with an automated fallback ladder ordered by availability and latency (e.g., gemini-3.6-flash -> gemini-3.1-flash-lite).
  2. **Error Recovery Matrix**: Catch recoverable HTTP/API status codes and sequentially attempt the next model.
  3. **Standard Helper Implementation**: Scaffold a reusable helper utility.
* **Server-Side Robustness & Payload Ingestion Standards**: 
  1. **Top-Level Request Deserialization**: Mount body parsers before endpoints.
  2. **Defensive Payload Ingestion**: Sanitize and guard input sources with fallback defaults.
  3. **Unified Full-Stack Dev Script**: Ensure boot of the unified server entrypoint.
* **Database Persistence, Clean Payloads, & Transaction Integrity**: 
  1. **Strict Undefined-Stripping**: Strip all `undefined` values before DB inserts.
  2. **Guaranteed Transaction Verification**: Ensure user input AND generation output are saved.
  3. **Explicit Error Escalation**: Display clear errors in UI for DB rejections.

## 7. README Generator
* **Objective**: Force the model to generate a professional, production-grade `README.md` file that guides developers step-by-step on how to configure, secure, and deploy the application to Google Cloud Run, supporting compliance with security rules and campaign verification requirements.
